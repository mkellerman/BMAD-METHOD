# Fagan Inspection Instructions

## Overview

Execute a comprehensive Fagan inspection workflow to achieve 60-90% defect detection rates through systematic code review methodology.

## Methodology

This workflow implements the formal Fagan inspection process:

1. **Planning Phase** - Define scope, select participants, schedule sessions
2. **Overview Phase** - Present code context and objectives to inspection team
3. **Preparation Phase** - Individual reviewers study code using checklists
4. **Inspection Meeting** - Systematic review to identify defects (not solutions)
5. **Rework Phase** - Author addresses identified defects
6. **Follow-up Phase** - Verify defect resolution

## Knowledge Integration

Consult the debug inspection checklist for systematic defect detection patterns and common issue categories.

## Process Steps

1. Load inspection checklist from knowledge base
2. Define inspection scope and objectives
3. Identify code artifacts for review
4. Apply systematic inspection methodology
5. Document findings with severity classification
6. Generate inspection report with actionable recommendations

## Expected Outputs

- Comprehensive defect inventory
- Severity-classified issue list
- Inspection metrics and effectiveness data
- Recommended next steps for resolution
