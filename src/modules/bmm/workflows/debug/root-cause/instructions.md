# Root Cause Analysis Instructions

## Overview

Execute systematic root cause analysis using fishbone (Ishikawa) methodology to identify underlying system issues beyond immediate symptoms.

## Fishbone Methodology

Systematic analysis across six primary categories:

1. **Methods** - Processes, procedures, standards
2. **Machines** - Tools, technology, infrastructure
3. **Materials** - Data, inputs, dependencies
4. **Measurements** - Metrics, monitoring, detection
5. **Environment** - Context, conditions, constraints
6. **People** - Skills, training, communication

## Process Steps

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly articulate the observed issue
2. **Category Analysis** - Systematically examine each fishbone category
3. **Contributing Factor Identification** - Map potential causes to categories
4. **Evidence Collection** - Gather supporting data for hypotheses
5. **Root Cause Prioritization** - Rank causes by likelihood and impact
6. **Verification Testing** - Validate root cause hypotheses

## Knowledge Integration

Use root cause checklist for systematic category exploration and common cause patterns.

## Expected Outputs

- Comprehensive fishbone diagram
- Prioritized root cause candidates with evidence
- Verification plan for top hypotheses
- Preventive measures to avoid recurrence
