# Pattern Analysis Instructions

## Overview

Analyze recent commits, code changes, and development patterns to identify systematic defect patterns and areas of risk concentration.

## Analysis Dimensions

1. **Temporal Patterns** - Timing of defect introduction
2. **Spatial Patterns** - Code regions with high defect density
3. **Author Patterns** - Developer-specific issue trends
4. **Change Patterns** - Types of modifications causing issues
5. **Dependency Patterns** - Component interaction problems
6. **Testing Patterns** - Coverage gaps and blind spots

## Process Steps

1. **Data Collection** - Gather commit history, bug reports, test results
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify recurring defect categories
3. **Hotspot Analysis** - Map defect concentration areas
4. **Trend Analysis** - Track pattern evolution over time
5. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate pattern impact and likelihood
6. **Prevention Strategy** - Recommend pattern-breaking interventions

## Knowledge Integration

Reference common defects catalog for pattern matching and classification of identified issues.

## Expected Outputs

- Defect pattern summary with frequency data
- Risk hotspot identification and mapping
- Trend analysis with predictive indicators
- Targeted prevention recommendations
- Process improvement suggestions
