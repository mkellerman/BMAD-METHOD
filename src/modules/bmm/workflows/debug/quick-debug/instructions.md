# Quick Debug Instructions

## Overview

Perform rapid triage and initial analysis for simple issues requiring immediate attention or time-critical situations.

## When to Use

- Production issues requiring immediate response
- Simple bugs with obvious symptoms
- Initial triage before deeper investigation
- Time-critical debugging scenarios

## Process Steps

1. **Symptom Capture** - Document observed behavior and error conditions
2. **Environment Assessment** - Verify system state and recent changes
3. **Pattern Matching** - Apply common debug patterns from knowledge base
4. **Quick Verification** - Test immediate hypotheses
5. **Triage Decision** - Determine if quick fix is appropriate or deeper analysis needed

## Knowledge Integration

Leverage debug patterns guide for rapid pattern recognition and common issue resolution strategies.

## Expected Outputs

- Issue classification and severity assessment
- Initial hypothesis with supporting evidence
- Quick fix recommendations (if applicable)
- Escalation path for complex issues requiring full investigation
