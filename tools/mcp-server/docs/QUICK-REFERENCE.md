## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

- Start with no parameters to explore options via BMad Master
- Use natural language when you're not sure which workflow to use
- Load specific agents when you know exactly what expertise you need
- Execute workflows directly when you have all required inputs ready

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Don't try to remember all workflow names - use natural language instead
- Don't worry about exact keyword matching - the intent parser is flexible
- Don't skip BMad Master if you're new - they'll guide you effectively

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Workflow not found"

**Problem:** Invalid workflow slug.

**Solution:** Use `bmad-list-workflows` or ask BMad Master for available workflows.

### "Agent not found"

**Problem:** Invalid agent name.

**Solution:** Check the agent table above or use `bmad` to see options.

### Natural language not routing correctly

**Problem:** Intent parsing didn't match your request.

**Solution:** BMad Master will still load with your message as context. They can help clarify and route you properly.
